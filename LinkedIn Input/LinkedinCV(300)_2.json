Most rewarding part of what I do is seeing the impact that my software can have on simplifying business operations resulting in great customer satisfaction. \\nIn previous positions, I worked for well-known companies like Country Financial, clients like State Farm Insurance and Sears Holdings, taking up roles of Java developer and technical lead. I worked on developing and enhancing product offerings in accordance with design and business objectives, and ensuring that development tasks are completed within the timeline provided and with minimal defects. \\nI have established a strong foundation in diverse software technologies with hands on experience in developing web applications applying object-oriented analysis and design principles, test-driven development, relational as well as non-relational databases, technologies like Java, J2EE, Web services, Hibernate, Spring framework, JavaScript, JQuery, GIS and mobile development. \\nI believe in staying updated with the new trends in the ever changing arena of information technology, exploring and coming up with innovative ways of applying them for supporting and enhancing business objectives. My innovative approach can be exemplified via one of my publications in the Issues in Information Systems journal and invitation for paper presentation at IACIS conference, 2013.",

I also recently spent a year on the Education Advisory Board of The DataLab, Scotland. I am very proud to be able to guide, shape and influence through the power of these forums.\\nI deliver technology projects for Information Security, managing several workstreams to execute against an agreed Cyber Strategy. As project lead I handle all aspects of the project including on-boarding of suppliers, Legal, Procurement, Compliance, internal governance processes and driving project delivery. My main interests currently lie in IT Security, Big Data, Cyber Intelligence and Innovative Technologies. \\nIn addition to my day-to-day role I am passionate about encouraging tech sector careers and skills. I led the University, intern and graduate engagements at HSBC's Stirling site and continue to engage with academia to make meaningful connections and introductions. As a STEM ambassador I champion the need for pipeline of young people into technology careers in Financial Services by engaging with students of all ages, from school to university. I have worked closely with Universtity Lecturers, SAS and The DataLab to build academic proposals for Scottish Universities which will aim to fill skills gaps in Data Science and Data Engineering. \\nPreviously, as a Business Analyst I was involved in a number of projects with HSBC including Server Consolidation, Grid Utilisation optimisation, Streamlining, Cost-saving to name a few.\\nIn 2013 I completed my MSc Business Analysis and Consulting which I passed with distinction. \\nIn my previous life, I enjoyed nearly 10 years as a serving Police Officer in Strathclyde Police in Glasgow, latterly working in the Intelligence Department. It was here I developed key skills in communication with senior management, detailed and accurate research methods, analysis and report writing.",
